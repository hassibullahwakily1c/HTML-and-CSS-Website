# HTML and CSS Projects

This repository contains the HTML and CSS projects that I completed during my HTML & CSS course.

## Projects

### Personal Portfolio Site

A basic portfolio website built as the final assignment for the course.  
It includes sections for:

- Home / introduction
- About
- Projects
- Skills
- GitHub information
- Contact details

The site uses only HTML and CSS and is intended to be deployed using GitHub Pages or traditional hosting.

### Space Station Site

A simple homepage for a fictional space travel company.  
This project focused on building a header, navigation bar, hero section with imagery, and content sections using semantic HTML and CSS.

### Movie Theater Site

A styled homepage for a movie theater.  
The site includes navigation, showtime information, and a basic layout for featured movies using HTML and CSS.

### Bootstrap Movie Library

A small practice project that uses Bootstrap components such as pill badges, buttons, and grid layout to display a movie library page.

## How to View the Portfolio Site

1. Open the `Portfolio` folder (or the root of this repository if the files are stored there).
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox).

## Deployment Notes

To publish the portfolio on **GitHub Pages**:

1. Create a repository on GitHub (for example: `html-css-portfolio`).
2. Add `index.html`, `portfolio.css`, the `images` folder, and this `README.md` file to the repository.
3. Commit and push the changes to the `main` branch.
4. In the GitHub repository, go to **Settings &gt; Pages**.
5. Under **Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**, select the `main` branch and the root folder, then save.
6. After a few minutes, GitHub Pages will provide a live URL for your site.

You can share that URL with your instructor for review.
